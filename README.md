# ðŸ§© Implementation & Comparison of Conventional Generative Models

This project is an **educational project** focused on implementing and comparing a variety of **generative models** on the **MNIST dataset**.  
It highlights the differences between classical model families and evaluates their generative capabilities in a unified framework.

## ðŸŽ¯ Educational Context
This project was developed as part of a **university course project on generative modeling**.  
It provides hands-on exposure to:  
- Building and training multiple generative models from scratch  
- Comparing performance and sample quality across methods  
- Understanding strengths and limitations of each model family
